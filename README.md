# LAB Assignment 4 Visitor Design Pattern
Problem Scenario:

You are a software developer working on an e-commerce platform that sells various types of furniture (chairs, tables, sofas, etc.). You want to implement a functionality that calculates the shipping cost based on the furniture type and size.

Each furniture type might have its own unique shipping cost calculation logic. For example, chairs might be lightweight and have a flat shipping rate, while sofas might be bulky and require a distance-based shipping cost calculation. Implementing separate shipping logic within each furniture class would lead to tight coupling and difficulty adding new furniture types in the future.
